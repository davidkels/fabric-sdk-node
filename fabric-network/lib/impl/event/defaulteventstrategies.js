// Strategy definitions:
// MSPID_SCOPE_ALLFORTX - Listen for all on your org
//   - add all event hubs for that org
//   - wait for all that are still connected, minimum 1) - DEFAULT
// MSPID_SCOPE_ANYFORTX - Listen for any on your org
//   - add all event hubs for that org
//   - wait for first 1
// CHANNEL_SCOPE_ALLFORTX - Listen for all peers in the channel
//   - add all event hubs for the channel
//   - wait for all that are connected, minimum 1 from each org
// CHANNEL_SCOPE_ANYFORTX - Listen for any peers in the channel
//   - add all event hubs for the channel
//   - add all event hubs for the channel, wait for first 1

// ---- COMPLEX strategies -----
// - Listen for any org peer for all orgs in the channel (add all events hubs, wait for 1 from each org)
// - Listen for all leader peers in the channel (if you can determine the leader peers)
// - Listen for any leader peer in the channel (if you can determine the leader peers)

// ---- Chaincode events ------
// strategy scope defines what event hubs will be connected thus all need to be registered for chaincode
// events, need to de-dup somehow. Can't just connect to 1 and if that fails, connect to another as we could
// miss an event. We may be able to cope with that if we track the block number ourselves internally.
